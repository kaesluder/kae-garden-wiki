Big technology companies do this routinely to push content to users and encourage doomscrolling. Given the recent changes and political controversies regarding content moderation, I feel it's quite clear that absent and insufficient content curation by big tech shifts the burden to individual users. This isn't a new problem, discussion of filters and killfiles go all the way back to Usenet and early email lists. The original plan involved developing an electron app using typescript to handle both backend and frontend logic. Since RSS feeds are notoriously variable, I was leaning to a NoSQL data store. A typescript/typescript framework can use electron inter-process-communication (IPC) for the data flow. Instead, I ended up doing another flask (python) backend with a javascript frontend. What happened? Constraints I had three weeks to bring a project from proposal to a working demo. In addition, we came home the first friday to find water pouring from ceiling vents due to a plumbing disaster from an upstairs neighbor. Dealing with API Churn One problem I ran into repeatedly was having a set of components that tested well individually but refused to compile and run together. Multiple Nodejs NoSQL libraries depend on LevelDB, and I could not get M1 Mac binaries for those libraries. Typescript worked very well up to the point when library functions started delivering custom data types. Some frameworks wanted ESM imports, while others insisted on CommonJS. All of these problems could be fixed with more time and expertise, but I felt that debugging babel and webpack configs was not the best use of the limited learning time I had available. Did Not Finish: Natural Language Processing This will be added to a future version. While python created opportunities to use stronger NLP libraries including NLTK and spaCy, developing the download/view features was necessary to make them useful. In the last few days, I adopted a soft freeze on new features to devote time to improving unit testing and documentation quality. Success: Hybrid SQLite Model Going into the project, I thought that I really needed a NoSQL solution. RSS is both not fully standardized and extendible, while my plans for filter design would involve polymorphism. Unfortunately, NoSQL was another area I couldn't figure out within the time constraints. Eventually, I discovered that SQLite includes SQL extensions for manipulating JSON field data . So I adopted SQLite and used a hybrid model of relational fields for data needed for searching and sorting, and raw JSON data for everything else. Success: Polymorphic Filters and Filter Storage I ended up implementing two different filter types. BaseFilter says \"yes\" to everything, while RegexFilter says \"yes\" to posts matching a regex pattern. Each filter is an object that knows how to apply its own criteria to a post, and to communicate what it is to the storage system. Storage is handled by exporting the config to a basic dict() and serializing it in an SQL table. I'll Take It: Building a Desktop App I never got Electron working properly. My javascript skills were not up to writing the different dialects expected of Electron and Reactjs. Electron works by packaging Nodejs with a feature-limited version of Chrome. There are other frameworks implementing the model including Tauri . Eventually, I just went with pywebview which uses a python backend with a webkit front end. A python/webview or rust/webview might be easier on my brain than a nodejs/chromejs framework. Long-term I'm planning on continuing development for personal/hobby use, and I'm comfortable just running it as a microservice on my personal computer. Final Thoughts It was a great, frustrating, and intense learning experience. Even though I was using a familiar stack, I had to innovate and push my knowledge on how to implement this project. Some takeaways: While I'm big on DIY, I don't feel comfortable doing interface design for others on my own. I'd like to put a lot more work into learning build and development tools instead of depending on boilerplate created by others. I'll probably continue this as a personal project, but it looks like my near future is going to be other languages and application areas. -- 18 February, 2022","title":"Drama Llama: Postmortem"},{"location":"Ada_Capstone_Documentation/Drama_Llama_Postmortem/#drama-llama-postmortem","text":"Drama Llama main repo","title":"Drama Llama: Postmortem"},{"location":"Ada_Capstone_Documentation/Drama_Llama_Postmortem/#the-plan","text":"The original goal coming into capstone was to apply Natural Language Processing to the consumption of social media and news feeds.

(Sometimes it's you.) Using the internet requires carefully curating or filtering through abundant low-quality content. Some of the issues include: Opinion pieces presented as factual news Low-research articles Overgeneralization from hot-takes Self-promotional material Meta-controversy about what someone else said on the internet about something that happened on the internet Explicit prejudice and harassment Context collapse Attempts by large social media companies to develop a centralized response to biased, inflammatory, and misleading information has become mired in political controversy. On top of that, those responses have become limited by a business model that monetizes user clicks and data about user clicks. Algorithmic views of information reinforce user behavior, especially when user behavior is addictive or compulsive. An evening of \"doomscrolling\" can bias the algorithm to presenting more of the same content, with trivial differences in information from article to article and post to post. Drama Llama is a curation- and filter-first newsreader. Users can build filters using keyword, regex, and trainable natural language processing (NLP) tools. This app will apply the same strategies used to detect email spam to helping users curate, summarize, and tag individual articles or posts. The user can choose to display this metadata at the headline level or use it to filter views. MVP Feature Set RSS fetching and viewing RSS is an XML standard for providing website, article, and post summaries. While many sites have moved away from RSS, it's still widely used. Keyword or regex tagging Simple search on feed content. Natural Language Processing (NLP) tags The first prototype will use very basic NLP algorithms such as Sentiment Analysis, Naive Bayesian Analysis, and/or Logistic Regression to tag text.

I'm lucky enough to have spaces for sharing quick thoughts, which are better fielded in smaller groups. Index and Curate; Don't Tag.

Therefore, anything here might change, move, or be marked as out-of-date. If an idea is worth exploring, the written documentation is worth nurturing over time. Limited Reactive Content. The problem with \"someone is wrong on the internet\" is that someone is always wrong on the internet. Frequently, it's me. Using blogs to talk-back at other blogs often ends up a inside conversation that should be kept to comment boxes or one-on-one conversation. Organize by Topic, Not by Recency. Explore how topics link together rather than create content for content's sake. Use Streams for Quick Takes, Vents, and Reactions. I'm lucky enough to have spaces for sharing quick thoughts, which are better fielded in smaller groups. Index and Curate; Don't Tag. Rather than tag based on what I think might be useful in the future, I can index around evolving themes after the fact. Ideas that already have a place can go into a folder with siblings. Avoid!

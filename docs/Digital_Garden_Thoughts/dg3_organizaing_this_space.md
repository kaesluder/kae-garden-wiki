# Organizing this Space

Just jotting down some principles on how and why this is not-a-blog. Rather than organizing chronologically (a web-log), digital gardens rely on curation and revision of ideas that grow over time or get pruned out. 

1. **People Grow and Change, So Should Ideas.** Therefore, anything here might change, move, or be marked as out-of-date. If an idea is worth exploring, the written documentation is worth nurturing over time. 
2. **Limited Reactive Content.** The problem with "someone is wrong on the internet" is that someone is *always* wrong on the internet. Frequently, it's me. Using blogs to talk-back at other blogs often ends up a inside conversation that should be kept to comment boxes or one-on-one conversation. 
3. **Organize by Topic, Not by Recency.** Explore how topics link together rather than create content for content's sake. 
4. **Use Streams for Quick Takes, Vents, and Reactions.** I'm lucky enough to have spaces for sharing quick thoughts, which are better fielded in smaller groups.
5. **Index and Curate; Don't Tag.** Rather than tag based on what I think might be useful in the future, I can index around evolving themes after the fact. Ideas that already have a place can go into a folder with siblings. 
6. **Avoid!** Comments and metrics.

# Publishing to Github and Settling on MkDocs

I spent part of my week working on rolling my own static site builder using
[clojure stasis](https://cjohansen.no/building-static-sites-in-clojure-with-stasis/).
There are lots of things I like about clojure, but I feel like I'm hitting a
point where it would be much easier to learn it if I knew a bit more JavaScript
or Java. Transfer from lisp/scheme gets more limited when I hit domains where
clojure says, "just use the Java/JavaScript native functions."

So, I set this up on github pages using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), more for some add-on features like recording the last-modified (according to git) date. Some rabbit holes
for the future include post-hoc keywords rather than a priori tags, and modding the 
fonts to look a bit less formal. 

Maybe... I'll rotate in Papyrus or Comic Sans just to annoy certain people .. :smiling_imp:

# Advent of Code 2022

Using [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) for daily programming 
exercises. My solutions are currently on a [gist](https://gist.github.com/kaesluder/83a91ac9e166d551575b38ca26559d23). It probably won't be updated on a daily basis, and I'm not committing to doing all of the problems in a timely manner.

I found a workable solution using the [John Bookma `pandoc` templates.](https://github.com/john-bokma/resume-pandoc)

Something I'm spinning my wheels on is the idea of creating a web-based resume. 
I'm a bit of a fan of write-once push-many and WYTIWYM (what you type is what
you mean). But a problem is that as much as we'd like to pretend, the sections
and subsections don't really match up to what is provided by vanilla html, and 
especially markdown. Should employment location and date be formatted differently? Then you have sections that are just lists of words. 

I tried out the Pelican [resume](https://github.com/suheb/resume) template, which 
puts all the content in the python config file. I have my own fork [pelican resume](https://github.com/kaesluder/pelican-resume) which modified some behavior and will rearrange some items.

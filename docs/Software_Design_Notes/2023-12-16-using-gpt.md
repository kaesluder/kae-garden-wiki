# How I'm Using ChatGPT as a Scatterbrained Coder

## Avoiding Google for Syntax and Boilerplate

There are certain syntax things that I just can't seem to hold in my brain. Some examples include:

- the find command: It's just enough different from other POSIX utils that I end up looking it up just about every time I need it.
- try/catch blocks: Different languages are just enough different to trip me up.
- building 2d matrices in JavaScript: Yes, there's a one-liner for it, but where do I put the fill and the map?

Why not google? I feel Google has really in recent years. Sites with paywalls and intrusive pop-ups often
displace manuals on the front page. The code quality I find there is often out of date or incorrect. Sometimes
this includes the instructional code _on_ the official sites. I expect ChatGPT to get it wrong much of the time, but
I have the same expectations of every online source these days.

The second consideration is that each new browser tab is an opportunity for my brain to get distracted and
chase down false leads or new ideas. Something like [shell-gpt](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt) can be run without breaking flow from my editor.

## The Smallest Possible Step

I've been using the "smallest possible step" strategy to get through rumination and churn. I ask myself
"whats the smallest possible next step I can take on this task." After I take that step, the next steps fall
into place. Sometimes I need it to come outside of my own brain:

```sh
sgpt --chat adhd "I need to stop thinking about how to create a search tool in python and take the next step. What is the smallest possible step after researching libraries and frameworks? Give me three options."

1. Choose a specific library or framework: After researching various libraries and frameworks for creating a search tool in Python, the next step is to choose a specific one that best suits your requirements. Consider factors such as ease of use, documentation, community support, and compatibility with your project.

2. Set up the development environment: Once you have selected a library or framework, the next step is to set up your development environment. This involves installing the necessary dependencies, configuring your IDE or text editor, and ensuring that you have a working Python environment.

3. Start with a simple example: To get started with implementing a search tool, it is often helpful to begin with a simple example. This could involve creating a basic search function that operates on a predefined dataset or file. By starting small, you can gradually build upon your initial implementation and add more advanced features as you progress.
```

I can then evaluate these responses and pick one to do. No. 1 is likely to send me back into a spiral
of trying to find the perfect framework. But I can set up my virtual environment and copy some easy
test cases into it.

## Solo Human + AI "Table Top" Roleplaying (TTRPG)

I've been a TTRPG player since childhood. Somehow, my parents gave me the D&D basic set in the middle
of the "satanic panic." Building a stable group of 2-6 adults has been very difficult. Solo-friendly
games like [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com) and
[Be Like a Crow](https://criticalkit.us/collections/be-like-a-crow) support storytelling by
providing a framework and _oracles_ that use dice or playing cards to generating story prompts. Some of
the pain points of this include:

- Expanding on ambiguous oracle results when blocked. What does "roughly soft" even mean?
- Putting my inner editor on hold for the game.
- Shuffling dice, playing cards, a notebook, and a PDF rulebook around.

Recently I've been testing this out using custom prompts and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
In RAG, the LLM client manages conversation history and "context" documentation using search tools.
The generative LLM builds a summary based on the documents I've just provided. Currently, I'm using
[Anything LLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm) to manage the background of the story and
the rulebooks I'm using.

The results have been fun, if not anywhere near the standard of professionally produced RPGs.
Even with Anything LLM feeding it context, ChatGPT doesn't really understand the structure of a scene,
much less a story. A fundamental rule is that _ChatGPT is often wrong._ I take what is useful and ignore
what is not useful, or give it explicit instructions to ignore ideas that it invented.

## Limitations

- ChatGPT is frequently and confidently wrong, but so is everyone else on the internet. I often joke that Machine Learning involves teaching a rock how to be just as neurotic and fallible as a human.
- It struggles a lot when you ask it for custom solutions. Which is why I don't really fear for the future of programming jobs. It's great at recreating textbook and tutorial code. It's not so great at fitting a function to a specific job.
- Most of the tools for RAG and managing context are still under development.

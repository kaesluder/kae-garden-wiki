## Problem Statement #1

Search engines currently provide minimal scaffolding for focused topic research. This project will reimagine the search interface by:

1. Providing a meta-search tool that incorporates results from general and specialized search engines. 
2. Encouraging the user to construct queries built on complete questions. 
3. Keeping track of how questions change through the search process. 
4. Encouraging the user to evaluate search results and add them to a growing concept map.
